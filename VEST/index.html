    <p><font size="5">4-5 June, 2020. Online</font></p>

    <p>At this two-day meeting, we will focus on the verification of
      session types using various thoerem provers, such as Agda, Coq or any other.
      We will have several talks to give us a context of what efforts the community has put on verification.
      We will discuss strengths and weaknesses of
      existing approaches, potential obstacles and how we can help each other.

    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p> We will have 30 minute talks. The speaker should present for around
    20 minutes, with discussion taking place at the the end of the presentation.
    During a talk (and in general if you are not engaging) keep your video off and microphone muted.
    If you have questions during the talk, then raise your hand and use the chat (bottom left hand of the screen).

          <p>We will demonstrate a work-in-progress tool for generating Java endpoint
          APIs from multiparty session types written in Scribble. The aim is to
          automatically produce APIs similar to those used in current practices,
          to minimise restrictions on endpoint implementation or integration with
          other development facilities, while promoting session type safety via
          the native type system of the target language. As much of the static
          session typing constraints for the source protocol is captured in the
          native Java API as possible, with the remainder of the session safety
          aspects handled by lightweight run-time checks built into the generated
          API.

            We discuss a type system that extends the linear pi calculus with pairs,
            disjoint sums, and regular data types. The type system adopts a
            different approach to linearity: on the one hand, it allows parallel
            processes to simultaneously access a data structure containing linear
            values; on the other hand, it provides stronger guarantees on the fact
            that linear channels are actually used. We demonstrate the type system
            at work on a series of examples and present a tool that implements the
            corresponding type reconstruction algorithm.

            how a similar approach can be applied to session types to capture many of
            the traditional uses of subtyping in type system based on parametric
            polymorphism.

          to build a higher-order notion of session type from Sigma and Pi, we
          find we must take care upon what exactly dependent session types can
          depend. What gets substituted for the bound variables when we
          instantiate the range of such a type? I argue that the correct answer to
          this question is not the session *participant*, but the session
          *traffic*. I show how to construct in Agda a universe of session types
          which enforce dependency only on traffic, and I offer some
          interpretations of these types as sets of participating processes.

            This talk will provide an overview of the language SILL, a session typed
            language currently under development at UIUC and CMU. SILL provides
            monadic process expressions, branching subtyping, both affine and linear
            types, and an integration of both synchronous and asynchronous
            communication. After an overview of the language, we will work through
            some examples demonstrating how these features play out in practice.

            In this talk I will present a code generation framework for type-safe
            and deadlock-free Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs. The code
            generation process starts with the definition of a global topology using
            Pabble, a protocol specification language based on parameterised
            multiparty session types (MPST). An MPI parallel program backbone is
            automatically generated from the global specification. The backbone code
            can then be merged with the sequential code describing the application
            behaviour, resulting in a complete MPI program. This merging process is
            fully automated through the use of an aspect-oriented compilation
            approach. In this way, programmers only need to supply the intended
            communication protocol and provide sequential code to automatically
            obtain parallelised programs that are guaranteed free from communication
            mismatch, type errors or deadlocks.

          <p><i>Automatising Proofs for Multiparty Session Types</i><br>

          <p>Developing distributed applications typically requires to integrate new
          code with preexisting third-party services, e.g., e-commerce facilities,
          maps, etc. These services cannot always be assumed to smoothly
          collaborate with each other; rather, they live in a "wild" environment
          where they must compete for resources, and possibly diverge from the
          intended behaviour in case they find it convenient to do so.

          <p>To overcome this issue, some recent works have proposed to discipline
          the interaction of mutually distrusting services through behavioural
          contracts. The idea is a bottom-up composition, where only those
          services with compliant contracts can establish sessions through which
          they interact. We exploit a theory of timed behavioural contracts to
          design and implement a message-oriented middleware where distributed
          services can be dynamically composed, and their communications monitored
          so to guarantee safe interactions.

            Just as data types encode the data used in applications, session types encode
            communication patterns, providing guarantees that protocols are safe and
            that programs conform to their prescribed protocols. Traditionally, session
            types have been checked statically at compile time.
          <p>
            An alternative approach is to use session types as a tool for lightweight
            runtime verification. This is especially useful in languages with
            dynamically-checked types, and in languages where session participants
            cannot always be assumed to be available.
          <p>
            In this talk, I'll explain my work on adding dynamic monitoring of session
            types to distributed Erlang/OTP server applications. Building on the work
            on Multiparty Session Actors by Neykova and Yoshida, I'll talk about how
            session types fit into standard OTP design patterns such as supervision
            trees, how to detect and handle failures, and demonstrate some larger
            case studies such as a DNS server.

            This talk will demonstrate the current status of Mungo. Mungo is a tool developed to
            statically check/enforce typestate on Java objects. Based on a small subset of Java 1.4
            without inheritance, Mungo can statically track the linear usage of fields, variables
            and parameters of a Java program according to a predeclared typestate. Our demonstration
            examples include the connection between statically enforced typestate and session types
            by using the Scribble tool to write session protocols and translate them into Mungo
            protocols.

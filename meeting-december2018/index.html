  <h3 id='vasconcelos'>Vasco Vasconcelos: <i>Label Dependent Session Types</i></h3>
  <p>
    Session types have emerged as a typing discipline for communication
    protocols.  Existing calculi with session types come with many different
    communication primitives that combine communication with the introduction or
    elimination of the transmitted value. We present a foundational session type
    calculus with a lightweight operational semantics. It fully decouples
    communication from the introduction and elimination of data and thus comes
    with a single communication reduction, namely the rendezvous between send
    and receive.  We achieve this decoupling by introducing label dependent
    session types, a minimalist dependent session type system. The system is
    sufficiently powerful to simulate existing functional session type systems.
    The new calculus also enables the construction of a more flexible gradual
    session type system. It improves over previous work by enabling the less
    precisely typed side to rely solely on the send and receive communication
    primitives.

  <h3 id='ferreira'>Francisco Ferreira: <i>Engineering the Meta-Theory of Session Types</i></h3>
  <p>
    Formal proofs of the meta-theory of programming calculi are
    important tools to develop a trust-worthy theoretical base. The
    meta-theory of systems with session types is delicate and error
    prone. I will talk about an approach to mechanise such proofs in
    the Coq proof assistant. In particular, I want to discuss some
    subtle aspects around the adequacy around a particular choice of
    representation.

  <h3 id='dezani'>Mariangiola Dezani: <i>Global Types with Internal Delegation</i></h3>
  <p>
    This paper investigates a new form of delegation for multiparty session
    calculi. Usually, delegation allows a session participant to appoint a
    participant in another session to act on her behalf.This means that
    delegation is inherently an inter-session mechanism, which requires session
    interleaving. Hence delegation falls outside the descriptive power of global
    types, which specify single sessions. As a consequence, properties such as
    deadlock-freedom or lock-freedom are difficult to ensure in the presence of
    delegation. Here we adopt a different view of delegation, by allowing
    participants to delegate tasks to each other within the same multiparty
    session. This way, delegation occurs within a single session (internal
    delegation) and may be captured by its global type. To increase flexibility
    in the use of delegation, our calculus uses connecting communications, which
    allow optional participants in the branches of choices. By these means, we
    are able to express conditional delegation.  We present a session type
    system based on global types with internal delegation, and show that it
    ensures the usual safety properties of multiparty sessions, together with a
    progress property.

  <h3 id='bocchi'>Laura Bocchi: <i>Time-sensitive protocols design and implementation</i></h3>
  <p>
    Existing work on timed session types leaves a number of open problems. On
    the practical side, they are based on simple abstractions, and do not
    capture : (a) primitives used in the real world, like blocking receive
    primitives (with and without timeout), or (b) realistic abstractions for
    time consuming actions with variable, yet bound, durations. On the
    theoretical side, a notion of duality for  in asynchronous timed interaction
    is missing. Duality would provide an answer to the question: “Given a timed
    asynchronous protocol for an endpoint, what is its natural counter-part?”.
    As I will show, this is a non-trivial question, and a naive extension of
    duality with asynchrony and time does not ensure the usual desirable
    properties of well-typed programs. I will present foundations of timed
    asynchronous duality, and provide a theory of timed asynchronous session
    types for a realistic calculus that caters for (a) and (b). Well-typedness
    guarantees communication safety and punctuality.

  <h3 id='castellan'>Simon Castellan: <i>Two sides of the same coin: Session types and Game Semantics</i></h3>
  <p>
    Game semantics and session types are two formalisations of the same
    concept: message-passing open programs following certain protocols. Game
    semantics represents protocols as games, and programs as strategies; while
    session types specify protocols, and well-typed π-calculus processes model
    programs. Giving faithful models of the π-calculus and giving a precise
    description of strategies as a programming language are two difficult
    problems. In this paper, we show how these two problems can be tackled at
    the same time by building an accurate game semantics model of the session
    π-calculus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our main contribution is to fill a semantic gap between the synchrony of the
    (session) π -calculus and the asynchrony of game semantics, by developing an
    event-structure based game semantics for synchronous concurrent computation.
    This model supports the first truly concurrent fully abstract (for barbed
    congruence) interpretation of the synchronous (session) π-calculus. We
    further strengthen this correspondence, establishing finite definability of
    asynchronous strategies by the internal session π-calculus. As an
    application of these results, we propose a faithful encoding of synchronous
    strategies into asynchronous strategies by call-return protocols, which
    induces automatically an encoding at the level of processes. Our results
    bring session types and game semantics into the same picture, proposing the
    session calculus as a programming language for strategies, and strategies as
    a very accurate model of the session calculus. We implement a prototype
    which computes the interpretation of session processes as synchronous
    strategies.

  <h3 id='kokke'>Wen Kokke: <i>Rusty Variation: Deadlock-free sessions with failure in Rust</i></h3>
  <p>
      This talk presents an implementation of deadlock-free sessions with failure
      in Rust, based on Exceptional GV by Fowler et al.
      We claim that it is a faithful implementation, which preserves much of
      EGVs metatheory.
      However, we depart from EGV in two major ways:
      First, EGV relies upon exceptions and handlers. Rust, however, has rejected
      exceptions in favour of monadic errors i.e., wrapping possibly failing results
      in error types such as <tt>Option&lt;T&gt;</tt> and <tt>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</tt>.
      Second, the core language of EGV does not include general recursion. Rust
      does. In the presence of non-termination, we cannot guarantee session
      fidelity, livelock freedom, or&mdash;well&mdash;termination.

  <h3 id='yoshida'>Nobuko Yoshida: <i>On Polymorphic Sessions and Functions</i></h3>
  <p>
    This work exploits the logical foundation of session types to determine what
    kind of type discipline for the π-calculus can exactly capture, and is
    captured by, λ-calculus behaviours. Leveraging the proof theoretic content
    of the soundness and completeness of sequent calculus and natural deduction
    presentations of linear logic, we develop the first mutually inverse and
    fully abstract processes-as-functions and functions-as-processes encodings
    between a polymorphic session π-calculus and a linear formulation of System
    F. We are then able to derive results of the session calculus from the
    theory of the λ-calculus: (1) we obtain a characterisation of inductive and
    coinductive session types via their algebraic representations in System F;
    and (2) we extend our results to account for value and process passing,
    entailing strong normalisation.

  <h3 id='castro'>David Castro: <i>Algebraic Multiparty Protocol Programming</i></h3>
  <p>
    Algebraic techniques for programming, i.e. constructive algorithmics or
    program calculation techniques, contributed significantly to diverse fields,
    such as datatype generic programming, program optimisation or parallel
    computing. Two major advantages of these techniques are their compositional
    nature and their rich equational theory for proving program equivalences.
    In the field of concurrent and distributed computing, the theory of
    multiparty session types (MPST) is used to specify the communication
    structure of message-passing systems, ensuring deadlock-freedom and protocol
    compliance.  In this paper, we propose a novel algebraic view of protocol
    specification that offers several benefits: 1) a high-level algebraic
    specification can be interpreted both as a function and as a protocol; 2)
    the extensionality of protocols can be defined and used to prove when two
    protocols support equivalent computations; and, 3) the extracted protocol is
    deadlock-free by construction, and any code transformation is guaranteed to
    preserve deadlock-freedom by the MPST theory.  We define an MPST-based
    coordination language, ParAlg, that can be used as an intermediate
    representation for compiling high-level specifications to low-level
    (parallel) code. This coordination language provides a global view of a
    concurrent/distributed system, that we use to explore the possible mappings
    of computations to specific participants (e.g. processes). We implement a
    prototype in Haskell, where we define the type of protocol generators and
    their combinators.  This new framework enables exploring possible ways to
    parallelise functions. To illustrate this, we feed the generated protocols
    to an existing tool for generating parallel C code using the Message Passing
    Interface (MPI).

  <h3 id='orchard'>Dominic Orchard: <i>Expressive Session Types via Graded Modal Types</i></h3>
  <p>
    Graded Modal Type Theory (GMTT) is a linear-by-default type theory with
    indexed families of modal types which can be used to track quantitative
    properties of programs. Using the usual technique of representing session
    types in linear types, GMTT can express session types but with much more
    expressive power than usual. I'll show two main examples (1) precisely
    bounded recursive session types (2) privacy tracking across communication. I
    will show these examples via real programs in Granule, a typed functional
    language in the style of ML/Haskell but with a graded modal type system.

  <h3 id='gay'>Simon Gay: <i>Multiparty Session Types for Safe Runtime Adaptation in an Actor Language</i></h3>
  <p><small>Authors: Paul Harvey, Simon Fowler, Ornela Dardha, Simon Gay</small></p>
  <p>
    Pervasive computing touches a wide range of applications, including
    sensor networks, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, and is
    an essential part of everyday life. At the heart of pervasive computing
    is adaptation: the ability of a software component to sense and respond
    to its operating environment, by discovering, replacing, and
    communicating with other software components that are not part of the
    original system design. Unfortunately, current programming languages do
    not allow for adaptive software to be specified in a way that enforces
    the safety guarantees associated with strongly-typed programming. For
    example, if a new component is discovered at runtime, there is no
    guarantee that existing components can communicate with it correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    We finally solve this problem by using session types, a type formalism used
    to model communication protocols. By associating session types with software
    components, the discovery process can check protocol compatibility, and when
    required, correctly replace such components. Moreover, the use of session
    types throughout the software system design guarantees the correctness of
    all communication, whether or not it is adaptive. We present the design and
    implementation of EnsembleS, the first actor-based language with adaptive
    features and a static session type system. We apply it to a case study based
    on an adaptive domain name server (DNS). Finally, we formalise the type
    system of EnsembleS and prove the runtime safety of well-typed programs.

  <h3 id='lande'>Stefano Lande: <i>Design and verification of Bitcoin smart
      contracts with Bitml</i></h3>
  <p>
    Besides simple transfers of currency, Bitcoin also enables various forms of
    smart contracts, i.e. protocols where users interact within pre-agreed rules,
    which determine how currency is eventually distributed. I will introduce you to
    Bitcoin smart contracts using Bitml, a DSL that abstracts from transactions and
    the underlying computational model of Bitcoin. Then, I will show you how to
    verify  a landmark security property of smart contracts, liquidity. In a
    non-liquid contract, it may happen that some funds remain frozen. The relevance
    of this issue is witnessed by a recent liquidity attack to the Ethereum Parity
    Wallet, which has frozen ∼160M USD within the contract, making this sum
    unredeemable by any user.  The computational soundness of the BitML compiler
    allows to lift this result from the symbolic to the computational level: if our
    decision procedure establishes that a contract is liquid, then it will be such
    also under a computational adversary, and vice versa.

  <h3 id='scalas'>Alceste Scalas: <i>Effpi: concurrent programming with dependent behavioural types</i></h3>
  <p>
    Concurrent and distributed programming is notoriously hard. Many languages
    and software toolkits address the challenge by offering high-level
    abstractions, such as message-passing processes and actors; they allow for
    intuitive reasoning, but do not formally ensure that a program implements a
    given specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will talk about Effpi, a toolkit for strongly-typed concurrent programming
    in Dotty (a.k.a. Scala 3). Effpi allows to specify the intended behaviour of a
    message-passing application using types: i.e., if a program type-checks and
    compiles, then it will run and communicate as prescribed by its types.
  </p>
  <p>
    The foundation of Effpi is a concurrent functional language with a novel blend
    of behavioural types (from the π-calculus theory), and a form of dependent
    types, extending to higher-order interaction (i.e., sending/receiving program
    thunks). This design has three main advantages. First, it allows to verify
    programs through a combination of type checking and model checking techniques.
    Second, it is directly implemented (via deep embedding) in Dotty, including a
    simplified API for strongly-typed actor-based programming. And third, its
    functional nature allows for an efficient runtime system, supporting highly
    concurrent programs with millions of interacting processes/actors.

  <h3 id='neykova'>Rumyana Neykova: <i>A Session Type Provider: Compile-time API Generation for Distributed Protocols with Interaction Refinements in F#</i></h3>
  <p>
    We present a library for the specification and implementation of distributed
    protocols in native F# (and other .NET languages) based on multiparty
    session types (MPST). There are two main contributions. Our library is the
    first practical development of MPST to support what we refer to as
    interaction refinements: a collection of features related to the refinement
    of protocols, such as message-type refinements (value constraints) and value
    dependent control flow. A well-typed endpoint program using our library is
    guaranteed to perform only compliant session I/O actions w.r.t. to the
    refined protocol, up to premature termination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, our library is developed as a session type provider, that performs
    on-demand compile-time protocol validation and generation of
    protocol-specific .NET types for users writing the distributed endpoint
    programs. It is implemented by extending and integrating Scribble (a
    toolchain for MPST) with an SMT solver into the type providers framework.
    The safety guarantees are achieved by a combination of static type checking
    of the generated types for messages and I/O operations, correctness by
    construction from code generation, and automated inlining of assertions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We evaluate our library based on several well-known protocols and algorithms.
    Our experience shows that our type-driven approach considerably simplifies the
    development of protocols, with negligible increase in compilation times.

  <h3 id='lange'>Julien Lange: <i>An empirical study of message passing concurrency in Go projects</i></h3>
  <p>
    Go is a popular programming language renowned for its good support for
    system programming and its channel message passing concurrency mechanism.
    These strengths have made it the language of choice of many platform
    software such as Docker and Kubernetes. In this talk, we present a study
    where we analysed 865 GitHub projects whose main language is Go in order to
    understand how message passing concurrency is used in publicly available
    code. Our results include the following findings: (1) message passing
    primitives are used frequently and intensively, (2) concurrency-related
    features are generally clustered in specific parts of a Go project, (3) most
    projects use synchronous communication channels over asynchronous ones, and
    (4) most Go projects use simple concurrent thread topologies, which are
    however unsupported by state-of-the-art static analyses.

  <h3 id='jongmans'>Sung-Shik Jongmans: <i>Distributed Programming using Role-Parametric Session Types in Go</i></h3>
  <p>
    This paper presents a framework for the static specification and safe
    programming of message passing protocols where the number and kinds of
    participants are dynamically instantiated. We develop the first theory of
    distributed multiparty session types (MPST) to support parameterised
    protocols with indexed roles—our framework statically infers the different
    kinds of participants induced by a protocol definition as role variants, and
    produces decoupled endpoint projections of the protocol onto each variant.
    This enables safe MPST-based programming of the parameterised endpoints in
    distributed settings: each endpoint can be implemented separately by
    different programmers, using different techniques (or languages). We prove
    the decidability of role variant inference and well-formedness checking, and
    the correctness of projection.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implement our theory as a toolchain for programming such role-parametric MPST
    protocols in Go. Our approach is to generate API families of lightweight,
    protocol- and variant-specific type wrappers for I/O. The APIs ensure a
    well-typed Go endpoint program (by native Go type checking) will perform only
    compliant I/O actions w.r.t. the source protocol. We leverage the abstractions
    of MPST to support the specification and implementation of Go applications
    involving multiple channels, possibly over mixed transports (e.g., Go channels,
